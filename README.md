# Customer-Segmentation-Recommendation-Engine

A data-driven project that analyzes customer behavior, segments users into meaningful groups using K-Means clustering, and generates simple product recommendations tailored to each segment.

This project demonstrates how businesses can leverage customer data to improve personalization, marketing strategies, and decision-making.

📌 Project Overview

Understanding customers is at the core of any successful business.
In this project, we:

Analyze customer data to identify hidden patterns

Segment customers based on behavioral similarities

Generate basic recommendations using segment insights

The goal is to show how unsupervised machine learning can be applied to real-world business problems.
